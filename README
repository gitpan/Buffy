NAME
    Buffy - An encryption scheme for Buffy the Vampire Slayer fans

SYNOPSIS
      use Buffy;

      print "Hello world";

DESCRIPTION
    The first time you run a program under `use Buffy', the module removes
    most of the unsightly characters from your source file. The code
    continues to work exactly as it did before, but now it looks like this:

      use Buffy;
      BUffY bUFFY BUffY bUFFY bUfFy buffy BUFfy     buFFY BufFy     BufFY   bUFfy BuFFY buffy       bufFy bUffy bUffY BuFfy BuffY   bUFfy BUfFY BUFFy       Buffy bUffY     
      BuFFY BUFFy   BufFy BUFfy BUfFY buFfy BuffY   BuFfy   BUfFY bUffy     buFFy   BUffy   bUffy 

DIAGNOSTICS
    `Can't buffy '%s''
        Buffy could not access the source file to modify it.

    `Can't rebuffy '%s''
        Buffy could not access the source file to execute it.
